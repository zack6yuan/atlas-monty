## The Monty Language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## Tasks

0. push, pall

Implement the "push" and "pall" opcodes.

The opcode "push" pushes an element to the stack.

The opcode "pall" prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack. 

1. pint

Implement the "pint" opcode. 

The opcode "pint" prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line. 

2. pop

Implement the "pop" opcode.

The opcode "pop" removes the top element of the stack.

3. swap

Implement the "swap" opcode.

The opcode "swap" swaps the top two elements of the stack. 

4. add

Implement the "add" opcode.

The opcode "add" adds the top two elements of the stack.

5. nop

Implement the "nop" opcode.

The opcode "nop" doesn't do anything.
